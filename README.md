# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code

## Day 1: July 8, 2018 (Face Recognition App)

**Today's Progress:** Implement an app that could be used by students and by somebodyelse like this Face Recognition App

**Thoughts:** This is my first time to share in a repo what I've been learning. It feels good and exciting, I will do more of this everyday for sure!
