# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code

## Day 1: July 8, 2018 (Face Recognition App)

**Today's Progress:** Implement an app that could be used by students and by somebodyelse like this Face Recognition App

**Thoughts:** This is my first time to share in a repo what I've been learning. It feels good and exciting, I will do more of this everyday for sure!

## Day 2: July 9, 2018 (Face Swap App)

**Today's Progress:** Implement an app that could be used for fun like face swapping

**Thoughts:** Pushing daily content on github is really hard, but I could intuitively feel the positive impact and drive this offer.

## Day 3: July 10, 2018 (Pose Estimation App)

**Today's Progress:** Implement an app in the web browser that could be used for curiosity and trying tensorflow.js

**Thoughts:** This is simpler yet I challenge myself to code it from scratch to exercise my understanding of this app.

## Day 4-6: July 11-13, 2018 (TFlite Image Classifier)

**Today's Progress:** Implement a mobile app capable of image classification

**Thoughts:** This took me 3 days to finish because of many installation issues, but I'm still grateful for the patience developed by such experience. Looking forward to my future self being able to handle this cases much wiser and faster. Also, I need to learn more about Java mobile development since mobile ML will be such a big thing. Also as of the moment, I've realized that wow I was able to apply machine learning in desktop, web browser, virtual machine, and mobile. What a simple yet pretty achievement just by following this 100 day ml challenge. Thank you, I'll do better next time for sure.
